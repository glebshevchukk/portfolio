                        95% of the world's biggest problems have some root in imitation. It's difficult to imitate how cancer cells grow, so we can't create cures for cancer. It's difficult to imitate how plasma moves through a nuclear reactor, so we can't create net-positive nuclear fusion. It’s difficult to imitate humans, so we can’t safely bring autonomous driving to the masses. At first, these seem like completely different problems, each requiring their own scientific studies, instruments, and techniques. 
                    <br><br>
I’d like to argue that imitation is the common thread that unites them, and that one of the most important problems in all of science is this: how do we imitate nonlinear systems?
<br><br>
Imitation learning exists in three, and only three, domains, each characterized by the type of structure placed on inputs and outputs. The first domain is also the simplest one: state estimation. Given random noise, how do we produce an output that matches the observed states? Image generation is a great example of this. Given random noise, how can a computer program produce a diverse set of images, realistic enough to fool a human? The second domain is state chain estimation. Given a sequence of visited states, where will our system go next? Weather prediction is one of the most valuable applications of state chain estimation. The third, and most complicated domain, is state-action chain estimation. At a state, what action should an agent take in order to imitate an expert? State-action chain estimation is the most important of the three because it makes problems proactive. Instead of just modeling how a nuclear reactor will perform, we can encapsulate how any action we take with its design will affect its performance.
<br><br>
These three domains collectively describe the problem of imitation. And though the last century has given us a plethora of models and algorithms to tackle them, there are still plenty of domains where our approaches are insufficient. This is perhaps why I am most excited to be a computer scientist in this age: the imitation approaches that we’re developing today — whether they’re rooted in statistics or information theory or deep learning — are all being developed to better imitate the messy systems that exist in our world. 
<br><br>
If successful, these algorithms will help prevent millions of deaths, protect our planet, and improve the progress of humanity as a whole. That’s why imitation is important.
