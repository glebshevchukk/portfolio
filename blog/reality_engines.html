The  Reality Engine is a hypothetical computer simulation that is so precise that it can model everything from inter-molecular to inter-galactic interactions. It is, for all intents and purposes, a virtual universe. And I’d like to argue that we should build it.
<br><br>
Simulating reality is not a new idea. Growing up, I was obsessed with The Matrix, a virtual reality where all of humanity could live comfortable, yet false, lives. The thinkers who inspired the Matrix, from Plato to Descartes to Putnam, all grappled with the question of whether reality is an illusion, and the thought is no weaker today. Inspired by stories like The Matrix, we have taken a technological twist to the simulation hypothesis, grappling with the question: are we living in a simulation?
<br><br>
I don’t have any strong opinions on whether we should find this out, as Elon Musk might suggest, or to try to break out of it, as George Hotz might suggest. Instead, I’d like to argue that far away in the future, humanity ought to recreate reality in simulo. And to do so, I’d like to give four short arguments for why the Reality Engine would be useful:
<br><br>
The Empiricist’s Argument:
As scientists, we want to understand all of reality, and the only way to do that is to simulate it. If we can encode all of our scientific knowledge into a single simulation, it would both allow us to preserve that information and to test it more rigorously as an entire system. 
<br><br>
The Simulator’s Argument:
Simulation can help us iterate on solutions to the worlds biggest problems much quicker. For example, if we can more accurately test cancer treatments on simulated human bodies, we can decrease experimentation time and arrive at treatments in a quicker and more cost-effective manner.
<br><br>
The Artificial Life Argument:
If we have a version of the planet that is as specific as our own, let’s use it to evolve intelligence. If we take a purely behavioral view on intelligence, the only arguable way to create human intelligence is to create an environment that is as realistic as our own and let evolution run its course through it. 
<br><br>
The Failsafe for Humanity Argument:
If humanity stands the chance of going extinct, it’s much better to place future humans into virtual reality than it is to let the species go extinct. This is perhaps the scariest outcome for humanity, but it would also represent a valid continuation of the human species. Would this world be Utopia? Or would it be Hell?
<br><br>
Each of these arguments merits its own long-form explanation, but I will leave you with these vignettes for now. Though this is a project that might take thousands or even millions of years to complete, I believe that we should keep it in the back of our minds as a guiding star sort of idea. And, though most of these arguments are not new and have been explored extensively, there has been little interest in actually recreating reality. 
<br><br>
That leads me to stress that we shouldn’t just try to understand our reality. We should re-build it.  </p>
